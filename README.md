# VR Solar System Tour
![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owntheweb/VR-Solar-System-Tour/dev/img/preview.png)

Take a Google Cardboard tour of the solar system! This project is just getting started, so prepare for several updates before it's usable. The end project will run as a PhoneGap app.

## Planet Textures
This project makes use of textures, normal maps and bump maps from [planetpixelemporium](http://planetpixelemporium.com/planets.html) (Murcury, Venus, Earch, Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune).

Pluto texture courtesy of NASA (coming soon, along with some others)

Skybox texture generated and altered from [this image](http://www.eso.org/public/images/eso0932a/) courtesy of ESO/S. Brunier.

## Audio
Audio will be added soon. At the moment, audio used in development is not open source (volunteered, used with permission for distributed app). I may place creative commons licensed music here for sharing purposes to start while finalizing music permissions.

## Three.js
This project is powered by [Three.js](http://threejs.org/).

In addition to personal time spent on this project, extra special thanks goes to the [Space Foundation](http://www.spacefoundation.org) team, supplying a Google Cardboard viewer, an iOS developer account (used for other projects and soon this one) and even a few on-the-clock training hours to dedicate towards VR development research.
