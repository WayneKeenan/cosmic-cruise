## Status
Everything has been considered to be stable enough for a first app release. The app will be available very soon.

In addition to personal time spent on this project, extra special thanks goes to the [Space Foundation](http://www.spacefoundation.org) team, supplying a Google Cardboard viewer, an iOS developer account (used for other projects and soon this one) and even a few on-the-clock training hours to dedicate towards VR development research (not to mention a week or more of in-office hours to finish up the app).
