# VR Solar System Tour
![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owntheweb/VR-Solar-System-Tour/dev/img/preview.png)

Take a Google Cardboard tour of the solar system! This project is just getting started, so prepare for several updates before it's usable. The end project will run as a PhoneGap app.

## Planet Textures
This project makes use of textures, normal maps and bump maps from [planetpixelemporium](http://planetpixelemporium.com/planets.html) (Venus, Earth, Moon, Mars, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune).

[Jupiter image](http://laps.noaa.gov/albers/sos/sos.html#JUPITER) credit: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute, color balance was adjusted in a subjective attempt (as suggested by Bjorn Jonsson) to better match the visual appearance of Jupiter in a telescope.
